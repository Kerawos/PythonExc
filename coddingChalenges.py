    Challenge 1.
    Something easy to warm up.
    There are N children standing in a line. Some of them may already have some candy.
    You are giving more candy to these children subjected to the following requirements:
            1. Each child must have at least one candy.
            2. Each child must have the same amount of candy.
    What is the minimum candy you must give?

    Example:
    Input: {3,2,1,0}, result: 6
    Input: {0,0,0},  result: 3
